# My Comments
So two things I think I solved well were
1. Architecture - I focused to architect the app for easier testability using MVVM architecture and having different layers for each separation of concern
2. Dependency Injection - I used Hilt to inject dependencies appropiately at all/most opportunities to enhance the architecture further and make it easier to test later

Things to improve upon
1. The particular list returned was relatively long so there are possible optimizations to be done eg cache offline,
2. I went with a basic UI so as to focus on architecture so this could definitely be done much better
